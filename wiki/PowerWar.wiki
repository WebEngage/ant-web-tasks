PowerWAR, as the name says :), is a powerful extension of Ant's [http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/war.html WAR task]. Apart from everything that the original WAR task lets you do, PowerWAR adds capability to perform property-injection and cache-busting.

== What is property injection? ==
Simply put, an attempt to resolve ANT build time properties names in specified files and replace these with their corresponding values.
<br/>
For an example, lets say you have a file 
WEB-INF/some-application-property.xml which has this content -
{{{
<bean id="dataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource">
 <property name="driverClassName">
  <value>com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</value>
 </property>
 <property name="url">
  <value>jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL.HOST}:${MYSQL.PORT}/${MYSQL.SCHEMA}</value>
 </property>
 <property name="username">
  <value>${MYSQL.USER}</value>
 </property>
 <property name="password">
  <value>${MYSQL.PASSWORD}</value>
 </property>
</bean>
}}}
${MYSQL.USER} and the likes are nothing but fancy placeholders. If there is a build property called "MYSQL.USER" defined in Ant, then this token will get replaced with the corresponding value.
