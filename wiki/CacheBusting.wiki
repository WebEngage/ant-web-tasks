== What is cache busting? ==
By cache, here I always mean HTTP Cache. HTTP Cache comes as a huge boon for performance. Clients (Browsers) typically store a copy of the HTTP Response and serve it from their caches unless instructed otherwise. In typical scenarios, this works very well. However, you run into a problem when you want to invalidate this cache. There are very few ways to achieve this. Cache Busting is one of the solutions to this problem in which a random string is appended to the HTTP Request URL, thereby "faking" an altogether new URL. The browser is forced to make a request as the URL itself has changed.

The PowerWAR task of this Ant contribution lets you achieve this from the comfort of your build.xml file.
