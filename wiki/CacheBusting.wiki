== What is cache busting? ==
By cache, here I always mean HTTP Cache. HTTP Cache comes as a huge boon for performance. Clients (Browsers) typically store a copy of the HTTP Response and serve it from their caches unless instructed otherwise. In typical scenarios, this works very well. However, you run into a problem when you want to invalidate this cache. There are very few ways to achieve this. Cache Busting is one of the solutions to this problem in which a random string is appended to the HTTP Request URL, thereby "faking" an altogether new URL. The browser is forced to make a request as the URL itself has changed.

The PowerWAR task of this Ant contribution lets you achieve this from the comfort of your build.xml file. Underneath is a simple example -
{{{
<taskdef name="powerWar" classname="com.avlesh.antwebtasks.war.PowerWAR" classpath="/path/to/ant-web-tasks.jar"/>
<target name="my-war-target">
  <powerWar destfile="distribution/myapp.war" webxml="web/WEB-INF/web.xml" compress="true">

    <cacheBuster verbose="on" versionFile="version.txt">
      <fileset dir="web"/>
      <rule from="/mysite/css/(.*).css" 
              to="/mysite/css/(.*).css?random=%{version-file-txt}"/>
    </cacheBuster>
    
    ...
  </powerWar>
</target>
}}}
As you must have noticed, a {{{<cacheBuster>}}} directive can be applied inside the PowerWAR task.
